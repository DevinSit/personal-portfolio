        Ah, frontend development â€” my bread and butter; what first got me into web development and what I've gone on to become rather comfortable with. These days, I'm heavily into using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong> with <strong>Sass</strong> to build <strong>Single Page Applications</strong>. <br /><br />

        Molding Flexbox and React components to my whim, I've come to really enjoy building beautiful, interactive interfaces from scratch.

const BackendDescription = () => (

        A great frontend is only as useful as its backend, so it's quite handy that I can work on both halves. As any strong JavaScript developer, I can comfortably throw together APIs using <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, but I've also worked extensively with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> to build machine learning based services. <br /> <br />
        
        Additionally, I've dabbled in the <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> world and come to love that batteries-included experience. And with <strong>Postgres</strong> as my go-to database, I can whip together some very robust APIs to back just about any interface.

const MobileDescription = () => (

        Although I'm primarily a web developer, I've also done my fair share of <strong>Android</strong> development -- both natively with <strong>Java</strong> and most recently with <strong>React Native</strong>. iOS development, however, is not something I've looked into yet; although React Native should make that a bit easier :) <br /><br />

        Being able to work in the cross-platform set of <strong>web</strong> and <strong>native mobile</strong> means that I can ensure the highest quality user experience possible.

const DesignDescription = () => (
    <span>
        Now here's something you don't see every day: a strong developer who can also <strong>design</strong>! Albeit, I wouldn't say my app designs are particularly ground-breaking or novel, but I like to think they're at least somewhat <strong>appealing to the eye</strong>, with a focus on <strong>usability</strong>. <br /><br />

        This is definitely an area that I'm <strong>constantly improving</strong> in; I'm always on the hunt for new design inspiration and seeing what I can adopt that works best from other applications. And when I do, my design tool of choice is definitely <strong>Figma</strong>.

const DevopsDescription = () => (
    <span>
        One of the big buzzwords du jour, the DevOps tooling arena is one place I've hedged quite a few bets on. I've combined my strong dev experience with some new ops experience to be able to develop, deploy, and monitor apps end-to-end. This means things like <strong>Linux</strong>, some flavour of <strong>CI/CD</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>/<strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong> are staples of my workflow. <br /><br />

        That last one is particularly noteworthy since I'm both a <strong>Google Cloud Certified</strong> <a href="https://www.credential.net/c5ek34qs?key=c1b6062f2b855942f6201ab308fb10415aa3069bfcd7d4198db54541a601ef72">Professional Cloud Architect</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.credential.net/h49ok4lg?key=23d7a8c6baed86e7438bf41d5242f029851270d36f4063c8b3306ffd7951267b">Associate Cloud Engineer</a>. Fun stuff.

const DataDescription = () => (

        A duo of buzzwords to eclipse even DevOps, the fields of <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> are certainly en vogue. My experience here comes more so from building <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>apps</strong>, and <strong>tooling</strong> around machine learning models, and less so from actually building the models themselves. <br /><br />
        
        However, that doesn't mean that I don't have a strong understanding of the <strong>data science process</strong>, and a rudimentary ability to build models with frameworks like <strong>Keras</strong> or <strong>Scikit-Learn</strong>.
